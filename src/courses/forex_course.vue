          Forex(forex exchange) is decentralized market, an open market where
          anyone can get in an out anywhere anytime but still there's more to
          the forex market. It's just not sufficient to get into the market and
          get out but to come out with profit. <br />Many people make the error
          of rushing into the market without adequate knowldege, without
          learning the basics, without understanding the fundamentals. Forex is
          not just all about trading here and there but being profitable in your
          trade is very important. There are many traders but about 90% of the
          traders are not profitable in their trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it magic to be profitable? is there a way out? is there a way to be
          profitable? the answer is yes invest in knowledge, invest in learning.

          market isn't running so taking out time first to learn is very
          important than rushing into investing without adequate understanding.
